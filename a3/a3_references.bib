abstract = {Generation of homogeneous populations of subtype-specific cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their comprehensive phenotyping is crucial for a better understanding of the subtype-related disease mechanisms and as tools for the development of chamber-specific drugs. The goals of this study were to apply a simple and efficient method for differentiation of iPSCs into defined functional CM subtypes in feeder-free conditions and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular, cell biological, and functional properties of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs on both the single-cell and engineered heart muscle (EHM) level. By a stage-specific activation of retinoic acid signaling in monolayer-based and well-defined culture, we showed that cardiac progenitors can be directed towards a highly homogeneous population of atrial CMs. By combining the transcriptome and proteome profiling of the iPSC-CM subtypes with functional characterizations via optical action potential and calcium imaging, and with contractile analyses in EHM, we demonstrated that atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs and -EHM highly correspond to the atrial and ventricular heart muscle, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and functional identities characteristic of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs and -EHM and supports their suitability in disease modeling and chamber-specific drug screening.},

               the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
               has been a popular choice for gene discovery through
               differential expression analyses of microarray and
               high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly
               strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such
               data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been
               significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the
               package can now perform both differential expression and
               differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.
               All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to
               microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These
               capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray
               data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now
               able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in
               a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of
               co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
               expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
               biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This

               activity and enhanced antioxidant protection in ESCs, both of
               which are downregulated during differentiation. To examine the
               role of telomerase for ESC self-renewal and differentiation, we
               overexpressed the reverse transcriptase subunit (Tert) of murine
               telomerase in ESCs. Increased telomerase activity enhances the
               self-renewal ability of the Tert-overexpressing ESCs, improves
               their resistance to apoptosis, and increases their
               proliferation. The differentiated progeny of wild-type ESCs
               express little Tert and show shortening of telomeric overhangs.
               In contrast, the progeny of Tert-overexpressing ESCs maintain
               high telomerase activity, as well as the length of G-rich
               overhangs. In addition, these cells accumulate lower
               concentrations of peroxides than wild-type cells, implying
               greater resistance to oxidative stress. Finally, differentiation
               toward hematopoietic lineages is more efficient as a result of
               the continued expression of Tert. Microarray analysis revealed
               that overexpression of Tert altered expression of a variety of
               genes required for extended self-renewal and lifespan. Our
               results suggest that telomerase functions as a ``survival
               enzyme'' in ESCs and its differentiated progeny by protecting
               the telomere cap and by influencing the expression patterns of
               stress response and defense genes. This results in improved
               proliferation of ESCs and more efficient differentiation, and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is a
               syndrome with pleiotropic manifestations including vasculitis
               and hematologic compromise. A systematic definition of the
               relationship between adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) mutations and
               clinical phenotype remains unavailable. OBJECTIVE: We sought to
               test whether the impact of ADA2 mutations on enzyme function
               correlates with clinical presentation. METHODS: Patients with
               DADA2 with severe hematologic manifestations were compared with
               vasculitis-predominant patients. Enzymatic activity was assessed
               using expression constructs reflecting all 53 missense,
               nonsense, insertion, and deletion genotypes from 152 patients
               across the DADA2 spectrum. RESULTS: We identified patients with
               DADA2 presenting with pure red cell aplasia (n = 5) or bone
               marrow failure (BMF, n = 10) syndrome. Most patients did not
               exhibit features of vasculitis. Recurrent infection,
               hepatosplenomegaly, and gingivitis were common in patients with
               BMF, of whom half died from infection. Unlike patients with
               DADA2 with vasculitis, patients with pure red cell aplasia and
               BMF proved largely refractory to TNF inhibitors. ADA2 variants
               associated with vasculitis predominantly reflected missense
               mutations with at least 3\% residual enzymatic activity. In
               contrast, pure red cell aplasia and BMF were associated with
               missense mutations with minimal residual enzyme activity,
               nonsense variants, and insertions/deletions resulting in
               complete loss of function. CONCLUSIONS: Functional interrogation
               of ADA2 mutations reveals an association of subtotal function
               loss with vasculitis, typically responsive to TNF blockade,
               whereas more extensive loss is observed in hematologic disease,
               which may be refractory to treatment. These findings establish a
               genotype-phenotype spectrum in DADA2.",

               in thyroid follicular cells occurs in the mouse at embryonic day

               implicated in transcriptional activation of Tg and TPO, even
               though the onset of their expression is at E9.5, suggesting that
               additional events are necessary for transcriptional activation
               of Tg and TPO genes. We report in this paper the cloning of
               TTF-2, a DNA binding protein that recognizes sites on both Tg
               and TPO promoters. TTF-2 is a new forkhead domain-containing
               protein whose expression is restricted to the endodermal lining
               of the foregut and to the ectoderm that will give rise to the
               anterior pituitary. TTF-2 shows transient expression in the
               developing thyroid and anterior pituitary. In the thyroid, TTF-2
               expression is down-regulated just before the onset of Tg and TPO
               gene expression, suggesting that this transcription factor plays
               the role in development of a negative controller of

  abstract  = "Transcription factors (TFs) and the regulatory proteins that
               control them play key roles in hematopoiesis, controlling basic
               processes of cell growth and differentiation; disruption of
               these processes may lead to leukemogenesis. Here we attempt to
               identify functionally novel and partially characterized
               TFs/regulatory proteins that are expressed in undifferentiated
               hematopoietic tissue. We surveyed our database of 15 970
               genes/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) representing the normal
               human CD34(+) cells transcriptosome
               (http://westsun.hema.uic.edu/cd34.html), using the UniGene
               annotation text descriptor, to identify genes with motifs
               consistent with transcriptional regulators; 285 genes were
               identified. We also extracted the human homologues of the TFs
               reported in the murine stem cell database (SCdb;
               http://stemcell.princeton.edu/), selecting an additional 45
               genes/ESTs. An exhaustive literature search of each of these 330
               unique genes was performed to determine if any had been
               previously reported and to obtain additional characterizing
               information. Of the resulting gene list, 106 were considered to
               be potential TFs. Overall, the transcriptional regulator dataset
               consists of 165 novel or poorly characterized genes, including
               25 that appeared to be TFs. Among these novel and poorly
               characterized genes are a cell growth regulatory with ring
               finger domain protein (CGR19, Hs.59106), an RB-associated CRAB
               repressor (RBAK, Hs.7222), a death-associated transcription
               factor 1 (DATF1, Hs.155313), and a p38-interacting protein
               (P38IP, Hs. 171185). The identification of these novel and
               partially characterized potential transcriptional regulators
               adds a wealth of information to understanding the molecular
               aspects of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic disorders.",
