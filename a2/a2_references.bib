abstract = {Generation of homogeneous populations of subtype-specific cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their comprehensive phenotyping is crucial for a better understanding of the subtype-related disease mechanisms and as tools for the development of chamber-specific drugs. The goals of this study were to apply a simple and efficient method for differentiation of iPSCs into defined functional CM subtypes in feeder-free conditions and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular, cell biological, and functional properties of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs on both the single-cell and engineered heart muscle (EHM) level. By a stage-specific activation of retinoic acid signaling in monolayer-based and well-defined culture, we showed that cardiac progenitors can be directed towards a highly homogeneous population of atrial CMs. By combining the transcriptome and proteome profiling of the iPSC-CM subtypes with functional characterizations via optical action potential and calcium imaging, and with contractile analyses in EHM, we demonstrated that atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs and -EHM highly correspond to the atrial and ventricular heart muscle, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and functional identities characteristic of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs and -EHM and supports their suitability in disease modeling and chamber-specific drug screening.},

               server for characterising and manipulating gene lists resulting
               from mining high-throughput genomic data. g:Profiler has a
               simple, user-friendly web interface with powerful visualisation
               for capturing Gene Ontology (GO), pathway, or transcription
               factor binding site enrichments down to individual gene levels.
               Besides standard multiple testing corrections, a new improved
               method for estimating the true effect of multiple testing over
               complex structures like GO has been introduced. Interpreting
               ranked gene lists is supported from the same interface with very
               efficient algorithms. Such ordered lists may arise when studying
               the most significantly affected genes from high-throughput data
               or genes co-expressed with the query gene. Other important
               aspects of practical data analysis are supported by modules
               tightly integrated with g:Profiler. These are: g:Convert for
               converting between different database identifiers; g:Orth for
               finding orthologous genes from other species; and g:Sorter for
               searching a large body of public gene expression data for
               co-expression. g:Profiler supports 31 different species, and

               Ensembl database. Bioinformatics communities wishing to

               integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
               experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
               experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
               the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
               has been a popular choice for gene discovery through
               differential expression analyses of microarray and
               high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly
               strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such
               data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been
               significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the
               package can now perform both differential expression and
               differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.
               All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to
               microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These
               capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray
               data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now
               able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in
               a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of
               co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
               expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
               biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
               article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,
               summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis
               on recent enhancements and features that have not been

               background noise to capture functionally meaningful biological
               signals is still challenging. Intrinsic sequencing variability
               introducing low-level expression variations can obscure patterns
               in downstream analyses. We introduce noisyR, a comprehensive
               noise filter to assess the variation in signal distribution and
               achieve an optimal information-consistency across replicates and
               samples; this selection also facilitates meaningful pattern
               recognition outside the background-noise range. noisyR is

               sample-specific signal/noise thresholds and filtered expression
               matrices. We exemplify the effects of minimizing technical noise
               on several datasets, across various sequencing assays: coding,
               non-coding RNAs and interactions, at bulk and single-cell level.
               An immediate consequence of filtering out noise is the
               convergence of predictions (differential-expression calls,
